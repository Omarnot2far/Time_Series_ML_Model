Time series analysis is a type of machine learning that is used to analyze and predict trends and patterns in time series data. Time series data is a collection of data points that are recorded over a period of time, typically at regular intervals.

There are various types of time series analysis techniques that can be applied to a given dataset, including:

1.Trend analysis: This involves examining the overall trend of the data over time to identify any patterns or trends that may exist.

2. Seasonal analysis: This involves identifying seasonal patterns in the data, such as weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles.

3. Autocorrelation analysis: This involves examining the correlation between the current data point and previous data points in the series.

4. Forecasting: This involves using statistical models to predict future values of the time series.

To demonstrate how time series analysis can be applied to a real dataset. The avobe notebooks were few of my work.
